# Pre work study guide project

## Description


This project was done to introduce various web dev fundamentals.
Namely, HTML, CSS, JS, Git, and GH were all introduced, as well
as how to start thinking like a programmer (or a computer).

For me, this was a good refresher of basic concepts.

I did not learn anything, although I did set up a new computer for
development and am excited for more projects.

It was a great refresher for markdown, which I have not used in a while!
